# Unity-ML-Penguins :penguin:

This repository is a Unity project that follows a tutorial on Reinforcement Learning, freely available here: https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/reinforcement-learning-penguins-part-1-unity-ml-agents

It uses reinforcement learning to create a penguin ai that catches fish then brings it back to its babies on the shore.

This tutorial was written using [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) version 0.14, which has since been updated a few times.  I did the project using release 5, version 1.2, but it's passed even that since 1.3 was released the same day I finished!  This document gives the migration steps: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Migrating.md

In short, this is a simple Unity scene that teaches a penguin AI to catch fish and feed its baby.  The baby is randomly placed on the shore, and the fish can move, adding complexity to the task.  Once everything was set up though, it didn't take long at all for the penguin to learn.

I did a more detailed write-up of it all in my blog post here: https://jonduke.github.io/2020-09-17-AI_Penguins/
