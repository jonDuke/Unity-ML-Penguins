# Unity-ML-Penguins :penguin:

This repository is a Unity project that follows a tutorial on Reinforcement Learning, found here: https://learn.unity.com/project/ml-agents-penguins

It uses reinforcement learning to create a penguin ai that catches fish then brings it back to its babies on the shore.

The tutorial was written for ML-Agents version 0.13, but there have been several updates and major changes since then.  This document contains the instructions for migrating to the new version, which I followed while writing the code in this repository: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Migrating.md
