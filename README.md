# Unity-ML-Penguins :penguin:

This repository is a Unity project that follows a tutorial on Reinforcement Learning, freely available here: https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/reinforcement-learning-penguins-part-1-unity-ml-agents

It uses reinforcement learning to create a penguin ai that catches fish then brings it back to its babies on the shore.

This tutorial was written using ML-Agents version 0.14, which has since been updated to "1.0 release 3".  This document gives the migration steps: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Migrating.md
